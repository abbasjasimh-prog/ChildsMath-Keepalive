# ChildsMath Keepalive

A minimal Chrome extension that helps prevent idle logout on ChildsMath by sending periodic keepalive requests while enabled. It does not modify the ChildsMath page UI and only runs on `https://www.childsmath.ca/*`.

## Overview

ChildsMath may log you out after about 15 minutes of inactivity. When enabled, this extension periodically sends a lightweight request to `childsmath.ca` to help keep your session active. The popup provides a simple On/Off toggle and shows the last ping time and last result.

## Implementation Notes

- Uses `chrome.alarms` to schedule a keepalive task (default: every 6 minutes).
- Uses `fetch()` with `credentials: "include"` so ChildsMath session cookies are included.
- Uses `chrome.storage` to store the enabled state and basic status (last ping time/result).
- If the site enforces a hard maximum session lifetime (not idle-based), a keepalive cannot prevent logout indefinitely.

## Running this extension

1. Download this repository:
   - Click **Code** → **Download ZIP**
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`.
4. Enable **Developer mode** (top right).
5. Click **Load unpacked**.
6. Select the folder that contains `manifest.json`.
7. Log into ChildsMath, click the extension icon, and toggle **On**.

## How to know it’s working

1. Toggle the extension **On**.
2. Wait 6–7 minutes.
3. Open the popup again:
   - **Last ping** should show a recent time.
   - **Last result** should show `OK`.
4. Real test: leave ChildsMath idle for 20–30 minutes and confirm you remain logged in.

## Configuration

- Change interval: edit `service_worker.js` → `intervalMinutes: 6`
- Change keepalive URL: edit `service_worker.js` → `pingUrl()`
